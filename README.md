# Game of Life
Game of Life is a **cellular automaton** devised by the British mathematician *John Horton Conway* in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Features:
- made with no external libraries
- work on CLI, no additional UI
- choose tick speed (default: 0.1)
- count interation
- Recognize **stop of motion** and **two/three phase recursion**

Available grids:
- Random grid
- Gosper glider run

Run the simulator:
```
./game-of-life-CLI.sh
```
