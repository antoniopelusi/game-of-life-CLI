# Game of Life
Game of Life is a **cellular automaton** devised by the British mathematician *John Horton Conway* in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

Features:
- Made with no external libraries (extra lightweight, 5kb)
- Work on CLI, no additional UI
- random initial grid generation
- choose tick speed (default: 0.1)
- count interation
- Recognize **stop of motion** and **recursion**

Run the simulation:
```
python3 game-of-life-CLI.py
